# PigBalanceGame
A simple 2D arcade game inspired by agricultural field. Will be related on some country animals who don't know where to go ;-D

**The elements on the stage**
1. a balance board where the pigs will be dropped
  * length will be random between the length limits
  * a balance limit where the board will fall out (too many pigs at the one side of the board)
  * stoppers at the both corners where the pigs will be turn around
2. zero or some max number of pigs/cows/sheeps/chikens...
  * random size between the limits
  * random speed (could be correlated on the size)
  * random weight between the limits
  * random outfit :-)
3. *the gravity properties here*

**the basic scenario**
1. a random amount of differend animals are dropped to the board
2. the animals will be moving instantly after landing (left or right, obviously :-))
3.
